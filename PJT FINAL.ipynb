      " In digital images, haze damages the image quality which are taken in outdoor environment. \n",
      "This causes the degradation of image quality in terms of color distortion and there exists a huge  loss in \n",
      "the contrast.  Because of the difficulty and importance of the problem, a lot of study has been done on \n",

      "successful  results  among picture haze removal approaches.  Furthermore, the addition of a guided filter \n",
      "has greatly improved its efficiency.  To address this issue, a n optimization approach -based  Image -\n",

      "additional refining.  Furthermore, image de -hazing procedures based on noise filtering perspective  are \n",
      "used to achieve the goal of saturation enhancement while adhering to the minimum hue change \n",
      "constraint.  The usefulness and efficiency of the suggested algorithm were evaluated by qualitative and \n",
      "quantitative analysis of the results.  \n",
      "Keywords:  De-Hazing, Krill Herd Optimization algorithm, Noise filtering.  \n",
      "I. Introduction  \n",
      "When taking images outside, a large volume of air particles will damage the image quality.  Haze, \n",
      "fog, and smoke are all categorized  as haze because they have a similar effect on visual readability.  \n",
      "Furthermore, color  distortion is caused by air interference [1].  In a range of applications, clear, high -\n",
      "quality images with high saturation, contrast, entropy, and other quality criteria are crucial [2,3].  \n",
      "This is a difficult endeavour, and much study has gone into tackling the pollution issue.  In recent \n",
      "years, various methods for image de -hazing have been presented; Liu [4] published a study and \n",
      "categorization in 2015, on Dark Channel Prior (DCP) [5].  Multiple image de -hazing [2,6,7], haze \n",
      "removal requiring additional information [8 –10], and single image de -hazing [11 –12, 25] are the three \n",
      "types of image haze removal methods.  Due to the additional  requirement of  resources high  \n",
      "computational  complexity, the first two techniques are not suitable for real -time applications.  Single \n",
      "image de -hazing has grabbed the interest of many scholars due to its simplicity and efficacy in picture \n",
      "de-hazing.  He [11] proposed a technique based on the notion of DCP in 2011, and it is by far the mos t \n",
      "impressive single picture de -hazing solution to date.  \n",
      "This paper describes an approach known as image Krill Herd - Haze ( KH-H), which is based on a \n",
      "notion proposed by Gandomi, et al.  [13]. High intensity and low saturation are the main characteristics \n",
      "of pictures polluted by haze in the form of noise . As a consequence, the intensity and saturation of the \n",
      "input picture are weighted to reflect the hazy severity  [24]. \n",
      "The same approach has been utilized  to estimate light  ambience ; however, when images contain \n",
      "excessively bright objects, a minor modification is necessary.  Picture noise filtering uses local data from \n",
      "the severity map after the two weighted maps have been constructed.  Four parameters are optimized \n",
      "using the Krill Herd method.  The purpose of this project is to increase the saturation of the final image.  \n",
      "The further paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses on the related work carried out on \n",
      "de-hazing the images. Section 3 discusses on image dehazing problem definition. Section 4 discusses, \n",
      "on the Krill Herd Algorithm  and its application to solve image De -Hazing. Section 5 discusses on the \n",
      "experimental results and its analysis and finally section 6 concludes the paper . \n",
      "II. Related Works  \n",
      "The RGB -HSV conversion [ 14] is used to turn the colour image into its monochrome counterpart.  \n",
      "The intensity (V -channel) is treated for contrast enhancement before being displayed in RGB format  \n",
      "(CHE). The Mean Brightness Preserving Bi -Histogram Equalization (BBHE) described in [ 15] was \n",
      "created for contrast augmentation while maintaining the output image's mean brightness.  In concept, \n",
      "the Dualistic Sub -Image Histogram Equalization (DSIHE) [ 16] is comparable to BBHE.  The sole \n",
      "difference is that DSIHE divides the input picture intensity into two sub -images using the median value \n",
      "rather than the mean value.  The median value is based on the picture content and may be less than or \n",
      "bigger than the mean value.  The technique of Recursive Mean -Separate Histogram Equalization \n",
      "(RMSHE) was proposed in [ 17]. This approach may be thought of as a more advanced variant of BBHE.  \n",
      "The split into sub -images, in instance, is performed four times to generate four sub -images.  \n",
      "Recursive Sub -Picture Histogram Equalisation (RSIHE) [ 18] took up the notion of dividing the \n",
      "input image into four components.  The division was changed to be based on the deciles of the number \n",
      "of pixels in the ordered ascending intensity values.  The rest of the enhancing technique follows the \n",
      "same steps as the previous procedures.  The Fuzzy Fusion based High Dynamic Range Imaging using \n",
      "Adaptive Histogram Separation (FFHAHS) method, which divides the picture according to an intensity \n",

      "once two sub -images are created.  The final improved picture is created by fusing the input and two \n",
      "enhanced intermediate images using fuzzy inference.  \n",
      "III. Image Dehazing  \n",
      "The notion of picture dehazing is to recover the real scene radiance of an image from ambient light \n",
      "(A) and the distance from the object to the camera lens  (t) [23]. A pixel in a picture may be described \n",
      "formally as  \n",
      "𝑃(𝑖)=𝐽(𝑖)×𝑡(𝑖)+𝐴(1−𝑡(𝑖)) \n",
      "where P denotes the real intensity as RGB values, J is the  radiance value at distance t, and A denotes \n",
      "ambient light.  However, for coloured images, the image is a collection of pixels from a single layer (in \n",
      "the case of GrayScale images) or three layers (RGB).  As a result, the key goal is to estimate the ambient \n",
      "light intensity and the distance between the camera and the object in order to extract radiance from pixel \n",
      "values.  \n",
      "According to a recent study, scene radiance may be recovered from collected pixels using noise filtering . \n",
      "The standard image representation has been recast in this style as follows:  \n",
      "𝑃(𝑖)−𝐴=(𝐽(𝑖)−𝐴)×𝑛(𝑖) \n",
      " where the transmission distance ( 𝑡) is treated as noise disturbance ( 𝑛). \n",
      "According to the investigations, the pixel value influenced by haze has a high brightness value (B) \n",
      "but low saturation (S).  The noise on a picture may be reframmed as follows based on these parameters \n",
      "B and S:  \n",
      "𝑀𝑛=𝜌(1−𝐵)+(1−𝜌)𝑆 \n",
      "where B is the average of the image's R ed, Green, and B lue (RGB)  colours, and S is the difference \n",
      "between the numeric value 1 and the pixel's minimum value P to the maximum value pixel's ratio.  \n",
      "Based on the scenic radiance, the parameter indicates the weight factor that limits the participation of \n",
      "brightness value and saturation.  \n",
      " \n",
      "where 𝐵 is the average of R, G, B colors of image and S is the difference between 𝑃 (minimum value \n",
      "of a pixel)  to the ratio of maximum value pixel. The parameter 𝜌 represents the weight factor that \n",
      "restricts the involvement of brightness value and saturation based on the scenic radiance  [22].  \n",
      " The noise map has been fine -tuned based on the factor  of shift -scale  as follows:  \n",
      "𝑀𝑠=𝛼+𝛽𝑀𝑛 \n",
      "Now that the total noise has been calculated, the final pixel creation in the real picture (i.e. Eq.(2)) \n",
      "may be reorganised as follows:  \n",
      "𝑃(𝑖)−𝐴=(𝐽(𝑖)−𝐴)×𝑀𝑠(𝑖) \n",
      "Apart from noise caused by transmission distance, ambient light has an impact on scenic brilliance.  And \n",
      "because this is linked to the brightness and saturation value, another constricting component, 𝑀𝑎, is \n",
      "generated from B and S as follows : \n",
      "𝑀𝑎=𝜑𝐵+(1−𝜑)𝑆 \n",

      "The final A can be cummulated as  \n",
      "𝐴=𝐴+𝛾 \n",
      "where 𝛾 is a correlation scalar value related to the atmospheric light.  \n",
      "When dealing with all of the values of  𝜌,𝛼,𝛽,𝛾 as weight factors, it should be ideal such that they do \n",
      "not deviate from the scene's real radiance value.  As a result, the parameter values are optimised using a \n",

      "a large number of issues in bioinspired optimization algorithms.  KH's working style:  When predators \n",

      "Many factors influence the establishment of the krill herd following predation.  Individual krill \n",
      "herding is a multi -objective process with two primary goals: (1) to increase density  of the krill  and (2) \n",
      "obtaining the food.  This technique is used to propose a swarm based  algorithm for tackling global \n",
      "optimization issues in the current study.  The krill's density -dependent attraction (growing density) and \n",
      "the search for food are employed as goals, leading to the krill herding around the global minima  [21]. \n",
      "When a krill seeks for the maximum density and food in this process, it travels tow ard the optimal \n",
      "option.  That is, the goal function decreases as the distance between the high density and food increases.  \n",
      "The weight factors of  𝜌,𝛼,𝛽,𝛾 will be used as input in this Krill -Herd optimization technique to \n",
      "obtain the optimum values.  The aim function that must be maximised is the output picture saturation.  \n",
      "Increased picture saturation without bounds, on the other hand, will result in an artificial output that \n",

      "Abstract: Images of outdoor scenes captured in bad weather suffer from poor contrast. Under bad weather conditions, the light reaching a camera is severely scattered by the atmosphere. The resulting decay in contrast varies across the scene and is exponential in the depths of scene points. Therefore, traditional space invariant image processing techniques are not sufficient to remove weather effects from images. We present a physics-based model that describes the appearances of scenes in uniform bad weather conditions. Changes in intensities of scene points under different weather conditions provide simple constraints to detect depth discontinuities in the scene and also to compute scene structure. Then, a fast algorithm to restore scene contrast is presented. In contrast to previous techniques, our weather removal algorithm does not require any a priori scene structure, distributions of scene reflectances, or detailed knowledge about the particular weather condition. All the methods described in this paper are effective under a wide range of weather conditions including haze, mist, fog, and conditions arising due to other aerosols. Further, our methods can be applied to gray scale, RGB color, multispectral and even IR images. We also extend our techniques to restore contrast of scenes with moving objects, captured using a video camera.\n"

    "abstract = \"\"\"Images of outdoor scenes captured in bad weather suffer from poor contrast. Under bad weather conditions, the light reaching a camera is severely scattered by the atmosphere. The resulting decay in contrast varies across the scene and is exponential in the depths of scene points. Therefore, traditional space invariant image processing techniques are not sufficient to remove weather effects from images. We present a physics-based model that describes the appearances of scenes in uniform bad weather conditions. Changes in intensities of scene points under different weather conditions provide simple constraints to detect depth discontinuities in the scene and also to compute scene structure. Then, a fast algorithm to restore scene contrast is presented. In contrast to previous techniques, our weather removal algorithm does not require any a priori scene structure, distributions of scene reflectances, or detailed knowledge about the particular weather condition. All the methods described in this paper are effective under a wide range of weather conditions including haze, mist, fog, and conditions arising due to other aerosols. Further, our methods can be applied to gray scale, RGB color, multispectral and even IR images. We also extend our techniques to restore contrast of scenes with moving objects, captured using a video camera.\"\"\"\n",
